# PyTorch Practice Project

This repository serves as a learning platform for understanding PyTorch and basic concepts behind Language Models (LLMs). The project consists of multiple learning exercises designed to provide hands-on experience with PyTorch's core functionalities.

## Project Goals

1. **PyTorch Learning Platform**
   - Explore PyTorch fundamentals
   - Understand tensor operations
   - Practice with neural network building blocks
   - Learn about optimization and training loops

2. **Simple Translation Model**
   - Develop a toy model for basic word translation (English to French)
   - Initial vocabulary: {'dog': 'chien', 'red': 'rouge'}
   - Learn the fundamentals of:
     - Token embedding
     - Sequence processing
     - Model architecture design
     - Training and inference in language tasks

3. **Additional Learning Exercises** (Planned)
   - [To be determined based on learning progress]
   - Potential areas:
     - Image classification
     - Time series prediction
     - Text generation
     - Reinforcement learning basics
